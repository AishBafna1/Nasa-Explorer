# ðŸš€ðŸŒŒ NASA Explorer ðŸš€ðŸŒŒ

Welcome to the NASA Data Explorer, a web application that allows users to explore and interact with a variety of space-related data using NASA's Open APIs. This application provides access to endpoints such as the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD), Mars Rover Photos, Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC), and Near Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs).

## Features

- Interactive user interface for exploring NASA data
- Visualization of space data through images and graphs
- Loading state management to enhance user experience
- Error handling for API requests and data fetching
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- User interactivity with filters and search functionality

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **APIs**: NASA Open APIs
- **Deployment**: [Render](https://render.com/) (https://frontend-pvks.onrender.com)

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nasa-data-explorer.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd nasa-data-explorer

3. Install dependencies for the frontend:
cd frontend
npm install

4. Install dependencies for the backend:
cd ../backend
npm install

5. Create a .env file in the backend directory and add your NASA API key:
NASA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

## Usage
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Start the backend server:

Open a terminal, navigate to the backend directory, and run:

cd backend
node server.js

The backend server will start on http://localhost:5000 (or whichever port you specified in your code).

2. In a new terminal window, start the frontend application:

- Open another terminal, navigate to the frontend directory, and run:

cd frontend
npm start

The frontend application will start on http://localhost:3000.

3. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

4. Explore the features:

- Use the interactive components to explore different NASA datasets, such as the Astronomy Picture of the Day, Mars Rover photos, and EPIC images.
- Filter and search for data using the provided UI elements.

## API Endpoints
Backend API Routes
- GET /api/apod: Fetch Astronomy Picture of the Day data.
- GET /api/mars: Fetch Mars Rover photos.
- GET /api/epic: Fetch EPIC images from the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera.
- GET /api/neo: Fetch Near Earth Objects data.

## Data Visualization
The application processes the received data and presents it through various means, including:

- Images for APOD, Mars Rover photos, and EPIC images.
- Tables or charts for displaying Near Earth Objects data.

## Error Handling
The application implements error handling for API requests and data fetching to provide users with meaningful error messages. If an error occurs during the fetching process, a user-friendly message is displayed.

## Testing
To ensure the quality and reliability of the application, I conducted various tests using the following methods:

- Unit Testing: Each React component was tested for rendering and state management using Jest and React Testing Library. This included tests for the loading state, error handling, and data rendering based on API responses.

- Integration Testing: I tested the integration between the frontend and backend to ensure that API requests were functioning as expected. This involved mocking API responses and verifying that the frontend handled these responses correctly.

- Manual Testing: I performed manual tests to check the overall user experience, including navigation, responsiveness, and loading states across different devices.

## Challenges Faced
Throughout the development process, I encountered several challenges:

- API Rate Limiting: During testing, I hit the API rate limits imposed by NASA, which caused requests to fail. To solve this, I implemented error handling to notify users about API unavailability and added a retry mechanism for certain requests.

- Data Formatting Issues: Initially, the date format for some API responses did not match what the frontend expected, leading to rendering issues. I addressed this by implementing a date formatting utility that ensured consistency across all data fetched from different endpoints.

- CORS Issues: When connecting the frontend to the backend, I faced Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues. I resolved this by using the cors middleware in the Express backend to allow requests from the frontend domain.

- Responsive Design: Ensuring the application was responsive across different devices presented challenges in CSS styling. I utilized CSS Flexbox and Grid layouts to improve the responsiveness of components.

## Error Handling
The application includes comprehensive error handling to manage edge cases such as:

- Network errors during API requests
- Invalid user input when searching or filtering data
- Displaying user-friendly error messages on the UI

## Deployment
The application is deployed on Render. You can access the live application at:

## Bonus Features
- Implemented responsive design to ensure usability on various screen sizes.
- Included performance optimizations for faster data loading and rendering.
- Added testing using Jest and React Testing Library for both frontend and backend components.
